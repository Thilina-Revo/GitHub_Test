    <p>Typically, logging in a user within your app by authenticating via a third-party provider requires visiting a login page hosted on a different domain. Before Cypress v12.0.0, Cypress tests were limited to visiting domains of the same origin, making programmatic login the only option for authenticating users with a third-party API. As of Cypress v12.0.0, Cypress tests are no longer limited to visiting domains of a single origin, meaning you can easily authenticate to federated AWS Cognito via the UI!</p>

    <h4>The documentation for Amazon Cognito recommends using the AWS Amplify Framework Authentication Library from the AWS Amplify Framework to interact with a deployed Amazon Cognito instance.

      Using the AWS Amplify Framework Authentication Library, we are able to programmatically drive the creation and authentication of users against a fully deployed back end.
      
      This illustrates the limited code from the AWS Amplify Framework needed to programmatically log an existing a user into an application.</h4>
