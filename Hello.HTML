    <p>Typically, logging in a user within your app by authenticating via a third-party provider requires visiting a login page hosted on a different domain. Before Cypress v12.0.0, Cypress tests were limited to visiting domains of the same origin, making programmatic login the only option for authenticating users with a third-party API. As of Cypress v12.0.0, Cypress tests are no longer limited to visiting domains of a single origin, meaning you can easily authenticate to federated AWS Cognito via the UI!</p>

    <h4>The documentation for Amazon Cognito recommends using the AWS Amplify Framework Authentication Library from the AWS Amplify Framework to interact with a deployed Amazon Cognito instance.

      Using the AWS Amplify Framework Authentication Library, we are able to programmatically drive the creation and authentication of users against a fully deployed back end.
      
      This illustrates the limited code from the AWS Amplify Framework needed to programmatically log an existing a user into an application.</h4>

        Component Support File
      </h3>
      <p>When you load a component or end-to-end spec file, it will first load something called a supportFile. By default, this is created for you during first-time setup of Cypress Component Testing and is located at cypress/support/component.js. This file gives you the opportunity to set up your spec's environment.

        For component specs, you use this file to set up page-level concerns that would usually exist by the time you mount the component. Some examples include:
        
            Run-time JavaScript code (state management, routers, UI libraries)...
            Global styles (style resets, Tailwind)......    
        As a rule, your Component Support File should look very similar to your application's main JavaScript (ie: main.js, index.js) and main CSS (ie: main.css, index.css) files.</p>
